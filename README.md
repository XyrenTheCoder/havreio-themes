# Havre.io Themes
All themes are created by A-76.
## Usage
Import `x.json` to [Havre Beta](beta.havre.io)
## Notes
- Yes, old themes from the script CAN be imported to Havre (and Diep Beta) in the `.dieptheme` format, but you CANNOT import Diep Beta themes OR the Havre Themes (in `.json` format) to the script.
- Some themes are same as those I made for Diep Beta, see [diepio-themes](https://github.com/XyrenTheCoder/diepio-themes).
